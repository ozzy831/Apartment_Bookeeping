Apartment_Bookeeping
====================
This is a MVC 4, Entity Framework web project I made (but have not finished) which allows a landlord record and maintain 
information regarding his or her apartment complex business. It is coded in C# and HTML (Razor). So far, the landlord can
store information regarding apartment complexes, their apartment rooms, and the managers who manage those apartment complexes,
any expeditures made for the apartments (ex. bought paint, door knobs, etcetera), and any bills incurred from those aparment 
complexes (ex. utility bills, plumbing services, etcetera). I have not worked on it due to me focusing on searching for a job to 
pay my student loans, but will do so when I find a job.
